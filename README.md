If you like watching video tutorials, you can have a look at this [playlist of videos on how to use `jurymatic`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWqZWxSNRmk83SRJ2hx3tqCu2GrglyhFW). If you're not into that, here's the quick rundown.

### macOS

1. Download the latest release from the [releases section](https://github.com/wolfskaempf/jurymatic/releases).
2. Unpack it and open the folder it contains.
3. Right-click on `install.command` and click `Open`.
4. Click `Open` again, indicating that you trust the source of the file.
5. Follow the steps on the screen. Enter your computer's password when asked.

### Windows

`jurymatic` requires both PowerShell (version 3.0 or newer) and Python 2 to work on Windows. Since neither are part of a standard installation, you have to install the software manually before using `jurymatic`. To make this as easy as possible, you can just double-click the included file `install-prerequisites.bat`. If your default browser is not _Internet Explorer_ or _Edge_ please copy and paste the following URL into either manually: `http://boxstarter.org/package/nr/dotnet4.5.1,powershell,python2` You might have to confirm the installation and enter your (Administrator's) password. After the script has finished, restart your computer.

1. Download the latest release from the [releases section](https://github.com/wolfskaempf/jurymatic/releases).
2. Unpack it and open the folder it contains.
3. Double-click on `install.bat`.
4. Allow the program to be executed despite security warnings when asked.

## Usage

After you're done installing the program, you can easily start `jurymatic` each time you need it. All data will be saved so you can easily add or change data.

**macOS**: Right-click `start.command`, select `Open` twice and `jurymatic` will start.

**Windows**: Double-click on `start.bat`

To quit `jurymatic` after using it, just close the window called _Terminal_ (macOS) or _cmd_ (Windows).
