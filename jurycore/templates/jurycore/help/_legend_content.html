        <h2>Overall Impression (OI)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The above mentioned criteria cannot cover all skills a delegate has. Therefore, the overall
                impression is not the mean average of the above mentioned criteria, but the juror's overall
                impression of a delegate. It can be different from the criteria above and include other criteria
                that might be important.
